{
LINEDISCONNECTMODE_BADADDRESS
The destination address is invalid.

LINEDISCONNECTMODE_BLOCKED
The call could not be connected because calls from the origination address are not being accepted at the destination address.
This differs from LINEDISCONNECTMODE_REJECT in that blocking is implemented in the network (a passive reject)
while a rejection is implemented in the destination equipment (an active reject). The blocking can be due to a specific exclusion
of the origination address, or because the destination accepts calls from only a selected set of origination address (closed user group).
It's appropriate as a blacklisted response. For example, a modem has received an answer, gone more than six seconds without detecting Ringback, failed to connect a defined number of times, determines that the phone number is not valid to call, and issues a 'blacklisted' response.

LINEDISCONNECTMODE_BUSY
The remote user's station is busy.

LINEDISCONNECTMODE_CANCELLED
The call was cancelled. (TAPI versions 2.0 and later)

LINEDISCONNECTMODE_CONGESTION
The network is congested.

LINEDISCONNECTMODE_DONOTDISTURB
The call could not be connected because the destination has invoked the Do Not Disturb feature. (TAPI versions 2.0 and later)

LINEDISCONNECTMODE_FORWARDED
The call was forwarded by the switch.

LINEDISCONNECTMODE_INCOMPATIBLE
The remote user's station equipment is incompatible with the type of call requested.

LINEDISCONNECTMODE_NOANSWER
The remote user's station does not answer.

LINEDISCONNECTMODE_NODIALTONE
A dial tone was not detected within a service-provider defined timeout, at a point during dialing when one was expected
(such as at a "W" in the dialable string). This can also occur without a service-provider-defined timeout period or without
a value specified in the dwWaitForDialTone member of the LINEDIALPARAMS structure. (TAPI versions 1.4 and later)

LINEDISCONNECTMODE_NORMAL
This is a normal disconnect request by the remote party. The call was terminated normally.

LINEDISCONNECTMODE_NUMBERCHANGED
The call could not be connected because the destination number has been changed, but automatic redirection to the new number is not provided. (TAPI versions 2.0 and later)

LINEDISCONNECTMODE_OUTOFORDER
The call could not be connected or was disconnected because the destination device is out of order (hardware failure). (TAPI versions 2.0 and later)

LINEDISCONNECTMODE_PICKUP
The call was picked up from elsewhere.

LINEDISCONNECTMODE_QOSUNAVAIL
The call could not be connected or was disconnected because the minimum quality of service could not be obtained or sustained.
This differs from LINEDISCONNECTMODE_INCOMPATIBLE in that the lack of resources may be a temporary condition at the destination. (TAPI versions 2.0 and later)

LINEDISCONNECTMODE_REJECT
The remote user has rejected the call.

LINEDISCONNECTMODE_TEMPFAILURE
The call could not be connected or was disconnected because of a temporary failure in the network; the call can be reattempted later and is expected to eventually complete. (TAPI versions 2.0 and later)
It's appropriate as a delayed response. For example, a modem getting a busy signal or equivalent too many times in a particular time period
concludes that the number should not be called again until a defined time has elapsed and issues a 'delayed' response.

LINEDISCONNECTMODE_UNAVAIL
The reason for the disconnect is unavailable and will not become known later.

LINEDISCONNECTMODE_UNKNOWN
The reason for the disconnect request is unknown but may become known later.

LINEDISCONNECTMODE_UNREACHABLE
The remote user could not be reached.
